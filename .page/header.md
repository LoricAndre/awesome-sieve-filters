# Awesome Sieve Filters

A repo of useful sieve filters by the community.
This is mainly aimed at [ProtonMail](https://mail.proton.me) filters,
but they should work with any sieve filter interpreter.
See [here](https://proton.me/support/sieve-advanced-custom-filters) for the Proton sieve filter docs.
